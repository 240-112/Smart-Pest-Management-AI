# Smart Pest Management using Lightweight Deep Learning and Explainable AI

This repository contains the implementation of my research work on intelligent pest detection and diagnosis using hybrid deep learning and explainable AI techniques.

## Research Objectives

- Develop lightweight CNN architectures for pest classification
- Integrate YOLO for real-time object detection
- Implement SHAP and LIME for model interpretability
- Enable multimodal prediction using weather + soil + image data
- Deploy optimized models on edge devices

## Models Implemented

- EfficientNetB0
- MobileNetV2
- VGG19
- ResNet50
- YOLOv5
- RADHARAJA 1.0 (Custom Hybrid Model)

## Explainable AI

- SHAP (Global + Local explanations)
- LIME
- Grad-CAM

## Performance Highlights

- Classification Accuracy: >99%
- Macro-F1: 0.97+
- Real-time detection latency: <0.5 sec
- Edge deployment optimized (TensorRT, TFLite)

## Hardware Used

- NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin
- Google Colab (GPU)
- Android Studio (Mobile Integration)
